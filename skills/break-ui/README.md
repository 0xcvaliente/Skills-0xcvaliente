# Break UI

Stress-test a component or screen with schema-backed and realistic worst-case data, empty/one/large collections, locales, and missing media. Build dev-only fixtures and report rendered failures; fix them only when requested.

Adapted for Agent Skills–compatible agents from [Emil Kowalski’s skills](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills),
pinned to [`e8a175de22ae`](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills/tree/e8a175de22ae1e49370fc144c1f3bb9aeedf988d).

## Workflow

1. Map every rendered field, its boundary, schema limits, optionality, and collection states.
2. Read CATALOG.md; construct plausible worst-case, empty, one-item, and relevant large-list fixtures.
3. Inject fixtures through the component’s real data boundary and expose a dev-only toggle or isolated route.
4. Render the original component at representative sizes and inspect overflow, clipping, wrapping, hierarchy, and performance.
5. Report findings and proposed corrections. Apply and recheck fixes when the user requested them.

## Output

Reviewable fixture controls, actual rendered failures, locations, and scoped corrections or proposals.

## Use

```text
Use the break-ui skill: stress-test this member list with worst-case data and report layout failures.
```

Compatible agents can also select the skill automatically when a request matches its
description.

Install the whole package by copying its directory into any
[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io)-compatible location. `~/.agents/skills/`
is read by several agents; each host also has its own folder (see
[INSTALL.md](../../INSTALL.md)):

```bash
cp -R break-ui ~/.agents/skills/
```

Use the project-level equivalent (for example `.agents/skills/`) for a
project-scoped install. Preserve local edits before replacing an existing copy.

## Agent behavior and requirements

The skill uses existing project tools, the shell, and whatever browser/app tooling
is available (for example a Playwright MCP server, a browser extension, or a built-in
browser pane). It does not install a runtime by being loaded.
Read-only requests produce findings; requested fixes proceed within their scope.
Dependencies and version-sensitive APIs must match the actual project.
Physical-device, release build, and performance claims require corresponding
evidence. The agent selects the skill automatically from its scoped description;
naming the skill explicitly (for example "use the break-ui skill") identifies the desired workflow.

An audit or review is a report by default. If fixes were requested in the same
request, implement and verify them rather than imposing another permission step.
