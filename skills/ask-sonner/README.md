# Ask Sonner

Configure, style, or troubleshoot Sonner toasts in React: Toaster setup, promise/loading updates, dismissal, themes, stacking, positioning, and multiple instances. Use when the project uses or explicitly requests Sonner.

Adapted for Agent Skills–compatible agents from [Emil Kowalski’s skills](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills),
pinned to [`e8a175de22ae`](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills/tree/e8a175de22ae1e49370fc144c1f3bb9aeedf988d).

## Workflow

1. Inspect installed Sonner/framework versions, Toaster ownership, providers, theme, and overlay layering.
2. Read the matching guide/API.md section and verify current version-specific options in official docs when needed.
3. Use the right toast lifecycle and avoid duplicate Toasters or duplicate action/event delivery.
4. Preserve accessible announcements, understandable failure feedback, and the project’s visual tokens.
5. Exercise the actual trigger, loading/success/error transitions, dismissal, dark mode, and modal interactions as relevant.

## Output

A focused integration or fix, with observable lifecycle checks and remaining gaps.

## Use

```text
Use the ask-sonner skill: fix these Sonner toasts appearing twice and losing the dark-mode styles.
```

Compatible agents can also select the skill automatically when a request matches its
description.

Install the whole package by copying its directory into any
[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io)-compatible location. `~/.agents/skills/`
is read by several agents; each host also has its own folder (see
[INSTALL.md](../../INSTALL.md)):

```bash
cp -R ask-sonner ~/.agents/skills/
```

Use the project-level equivalent (for example `.agents/skills/`) for a
project-scoped install. Preserve local edits before replacing an existing copy.

## Agent behavior and requirements

The skill uses existing project tools, the shell, and whatever browser/app tooling
is available (for example a Playwright MCP server, a browser extension, or a built-in
browser pane). It does not install a runtime by being loaded.
Read-only requests produce findings; requested fixes proceed within their scope.
Dependencies and version-sensitive APIs must match the actual project.
Physical-device, release build, and performance claims require corresponding
evidence. The agent selects the skill automatically from its scoped description;
naming the skill explicitly (for example "use the ask-sonner skill") identifies the desired workflow.
